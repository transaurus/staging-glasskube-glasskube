                Glasskube is a software company based in Vienna, Austria and
                Chicago, USA.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company specializes in cloud computing, Kubernetes, DevOps,
                and software distribution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Glasskube originally developed the Glasskube Kubernetes Package
                Manager, an Open Source project designed to simplify the
                installation and management of applications on Kubernetes
                clusters.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project is no longer actively maintained and is considered
                discontinued.
              </p>
              <p>
                It remains available for reference but should not be used in
                production.
              </p>
              <p>
                Building on the lessons learned from that project, Glasskube
                created Distr (
                <Link href="https://distr.sh">https://distr.sh</Link>) a modern
                software distribution platform to distribute applications and
                artifacts to self-managed environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Distr provides tooling for self-managed, BYOC, air-gapped, and
                edge deployments while giving vendors visibility and control
                throughout the application lifecycle.{' '}
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Distr is Glasskube's actively developed and supported
                product, used by vendors and AI infrastructure teams worldwide.
